The Chemical Physics Congress series (CPC) is honored to commemorate Professor Zekiye Çınar's memory. Renowned for her work in heterogeneous photocatalysis and reaction kinetics, she was admired for her refined personality. As a member of the CPC Scientific Committee, she organized the series' fifth congress (CPC-5) at Yıldız Technical University in 2002.
 
In loving memory of Professor Çınar, her students and the CPC Scientific Committee have established the Zekiye Çınar Chemical Physics Poster Awards, generously funded by the Çınar family. These awards will recognize the presenters of the top three posters at CPC-14, with prizes of 3500 TL for first place, 2500 TL for second, and 1500 TL for third. The winners will be announced by the CPC Scientific Committee during the closing session of the CPC-14 congress.
 
These poster prizes pay tribute to Professor Çınar’s achievements and her dedication to education. She will be fondly remembered for her grace and kindness, serving as an enduring example for the CPC community.

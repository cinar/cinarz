# Physical Chemistry II (Spring 2013)

## Course Goals

This course provides the basic knowledge on chemical thermodynamics. It offers an understanding of the fundamental principals and laws of thermodynamics, thermodynamic functions and their methods of calculation.

You will first learn the basic terms and definitions. Then, you will learn the four fundamental laws of thermodynamics, thermodynamic functions, their methods of calculation and how they can be applied to pure substances and mixtures. You will develop the ability to explain the reasons behind all natural phenomena, to find relations between reason and result, to determine the optimum conditions for all chemical operations and processes, to calculate all the equilibrium properties and finally you will be able to examine all the natural, technical or even social phenomena thermodynamically.
